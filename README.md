# MovePacMan
 
MovePacMan is a program the has the PacMan image switching form the image with his mouth open to the image of his mouth close repeatedly as he moves across the screen. As he hits the edge off the screen, he would reverse direction and go the other way as well as the images changing direction.

At the moment my class is learning JavaScript, so all the coding I did was in JavaScript. This project was an assignment given in NextTech. We were given all that we needed for the program to work. We were just asked to add the setInterval, add the arugmuent 'pageWidth' to the Run() function, and finish the checkPageBounds(), when given the function line and the return line of the function.
